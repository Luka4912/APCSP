  <h1>Welcome to my projects page! Here are a few of my projects</h1>

 <p>This project was an english assingment where we had to modle the style and subject of two poets. The first is Robert </p> 
 <p>Forst and the second is Walt Witman. I really enjoyed writing the peoms because it was a lot more challanging than I </p> <p>expected. I particularly like the Robert frost one because I think I was able to encapsulate his style well.</p>

 <p>This project presents a portfolio of writings from my Junior year. The writings placed in this portfolio are </p>
<p>some of my favorite pieces from the year, and are representative of the skills I’ve cultivated and the effort</p>
<p> I’ve put forth throughout the year. In addition, I include a reflective letter that summarizes each of the chosen pieces.</p>
